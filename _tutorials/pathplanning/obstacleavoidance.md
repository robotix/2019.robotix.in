##### Introduction

Path tracking and obstacle avoidance are two very important behaviours
that must be considered in the process of developing Autonomous Ground
Vehicles, AGV.There are many well known path tracking algorithms, like
follow-the-carrot and pure-pursuit, as well as the more recently developed
vector-pursuit tracking method.

The following Block diagram will give you the gist of this tutorial.

##### Dead reckoning

Dead reckoning is a method used for determining the current position of a
vehicle, by advancing some previous position through known course and
velocity information over a given time period. Most of the robotic ground
vehicles today rely on dead reckoning as the framework of their
navigational systems. One simple way to implement dead reckoning is
called odometry. Odometry is a method to provide information about vehicle
displacement based on the rotation of its motors or wheels. The rotation
is measured by wheel or shaft encoders. These encoders counts the number of
rotations of the wheel axles, providing data that combined with the
forward kinematics equations can be translated to information regarding
the change in position and heading of the vehicle. Figure below shows a
picture of the normal configuration and placement of encoders and motors
on a differential drive ground robot vehicle.

##### Differential drive kinematics

The theory behind differential drive kinematics is pretty straightforward.
Every wheeled mobile robot in a state of motion must always rotate about
a point that lies somewhere on the common axis of the two wheels. This
point is often called the instantaneous centre of curvature (ICC), or
the instantaneous centre of rotation (ICR). A differential drive robot
changes the position of the ICC simply by varying the velocities of the
two  wheels. Two separate drive motors, one for each wheel, provide
independent velocity control to the left and right wheels. It is this
property that makes it possible for the robot to choose different
trajectories and paths. A sketch describing the kinematics of a
differential drive mobile robot can be seen in figure below.

##### VARIOUS ALGORITHMS

###### 1.Follow-the-carrot

This algorithm is based on a very simple idea. Obtain a goal-point, then
aim the vehicle towards that point. Figure below describes the basics
behind this method.

###### 2.Pure Pursuit

The concept of the pure pursuit approach is to calculate the curvature
that will take the vehicle from its current position to a goal position.
The goal point is determined in the same manner as for the
follow-the-carrot algorithm. A circle is then defined in such a way that
it passes through both the goal point and the current vehicle position.
Finally a control algorithm chooses a steering angle in relation to this
circle. Infact, the robot vehicle changes its curvature by repeatedly
fitting circular arcs of this kind, always pushing the goal point forward.

###### 3.Vector Pursuit

Vector pursuit is a new path tracking method that uses the theory of
screws first introduced by Sir Robert S. Ball in 1900. Screw theory can
be used to represent the motion of any rigid body in relation to a given
coordinate system, thus making it useful in path tracking applications.
Any instantaneous motion can be described as a rotation about a line in
space with and associated pitch.

###### The look-ahead distance

Common to all these methods is that they use a look-ahead point, which
is a point on the path a certain distance L away from the orthogonal
projection of the vehicleâ€™s position on the path. Changing the look-ahead
distance can have a significant effect on the performance of the
algorithm.  There are two problems that need to be considered:

1. Regaining a path

2. Maintaining the path

The first problem occurs when the vehicle is way off the path, thus having
large positional and orientation errors, and is trying to return to this
path. A larger value causes the vehicle to converge more smoothly and with
less oscillations. On the other side, once back on the path a large value
will lead to worse tracking, especially in the case of paths containing
very sharp curves.

##### Factors to be considered while choosing the look-ahead distance

* Vehicle Speed

* Is the path obstacle free

##### Obstacle Avoidance

The obstacle avoidance unit is a simple local implementation based entirely
on **proximity sensors**. We can  implement some kind of global obstacle
avoidance algorithm, like the Potential Field method or the Vector Field
Histogram method or local ones. The global methods are better but they
require **more accurate ultrasonic sensors.**

**Give below is an example of a local method of obstacle avoidance :**

During the tracking phase the obstacle avoidance unit is responsible for repeatedly checking the four proximity sensors in the front. If any obstacles are detected the robot stops, rotates 90 degrees in some direction, and thereafter follows the edge of the obstacle until it points towards the current goal point again and no obstacle are in front of the robot. Thus the obstacle avoidance unit consists of three phases:

1. Stop
2. Rotate
3. Follow edge

A stop and rotate phase may seem unnecessary, but I saw no other
possibility considering the bad accuracy of the proximity sensors.
These sensors can only detect obstacles at a maximum distance of
approximately three centimetres, so without these phases the robot would
bump into the obstacle instead of avoiding it.
