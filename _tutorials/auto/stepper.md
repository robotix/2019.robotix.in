A stepper motor or step motor or stepping motor is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. 
The motor's position can then be commanded to move and hold at one of these steps without any position sensor for feedback (an open-loop controller), as long as the motor is carefully sized to the application in respect to torque and speed.
Commercially, stepper motors are used in floppy disk drives, flatbed scanners, computer printers, plotters, slot machines, image scanners, compact disc drives, intelligent lighting, camera lenses, CNC machines and, more recently, in 3D printers.

Here is the [link](https://youtu.be/B86nqDRskVU) to a video tutorial that will guide you through the basic understanding of the motor functioning and all the other details that you would want to know.
