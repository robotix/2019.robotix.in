#### Circuitry

We will now understand the basic working of taking input through pins with the help of '**push buttons**'. Get hold of one (these are pretty cheap) and connect it like the following circuit.

Note the use of a **pull-down resistor** (150 ohms) in conjunction with the push button. To understand how pull-down and pull-up resistors work, refer to (this)[2].

#### Code

Now enter the code:

Plug in the Arduino, click Verify, then Upload if no errors are found. The **breadboard LED should be turned off by default and should glow as long as the button is depressed.**

#### Understanding the Code

* Most of the code should be easy to figure out once you have understood the previous examples.
* Note the pins from which output has to be gathered are set to the INPUT pinMode in the setup block.
* digitalRead(pin)Â This** function returns a boolean value - HIGH if the pin is high and LOW if the pin is low**.

#### Internal Pull-Up Resistors

Conveniently, the **Arduino contains pull-up resistors** that are connected to the pins (the analog pins have pull-up resistors also). These have a **value of 20K ohms and need to be activated within software** to use them. To activate an internal pull-up resistor on a pin, you first need to change the pinMode of the pin to an INPUT and then write a HIGH to that pin using a digitalWrite command. Make sure that your button is connected across the pin and the ground in this case:

```c
pinMode(pin, INPUT);
digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);
```

Note that now pressing the button will cause the state variable to read LOW and otherwise HIGH by default. The wire connecting the push button to +5V is no longer needed. The circuit should be like this:
