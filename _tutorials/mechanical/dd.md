#### Introduction

![][1]{:.img-responsive}

This is a primer project which covers following concepts-

1.Power Supply (Adapter or Rectifier)or 12v battery  
2.Three way switch operation.  
3.DC Geared Motors  
4.Basic motion of Robot

#### Components Required

1. Soldering Iron
2. Soldering Wire
3. Wire Stripper
4. Single strand wires
5. Multi strand wire of appropriate length
6. PCB (dot)(optional if using adapter)
7. 4 Diodes (D1N4007)(optional if using adapter)
8. 1 Electrolytic Capacitor (1000 microfarad)
9. Step down Transformer (220v- 12V AC)
10. Two 3 way switches or Two 2 way switches and two push button switches.
11. 2 plastic boxes to encase transformer and for control box
12. Plug for transformer(optional if using adapter)
13. 2 pin, 4 pin relimates
14. Insulation Tape
15. IC 7805(optional if using adapter)
16. DC motors
17. Breadboard (optional)
18. Multimeter

#### Chassis

Chassis is a mechanical assembly for making a 4 wheel drive platform.Where you can mount any controller board to drive your bot. This is just the mechanical chassis, Optionally as shown in the figure you can use 4 DC geared motors, 1 castor and 4 wheels with rubber rings so you can make both variants .

Fit the caster wheel at position show in above diagram with 1.5-2 inches (approx.) screw. Fit the dc motor into the holes of chassis and couple the wheel by using screw or rubber tube.
