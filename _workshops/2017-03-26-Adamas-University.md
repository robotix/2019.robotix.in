In the outskirts of Kolkata, with a drive of about an hour and a half,
there exists a small university with a wide vision. Seeing the culture
and scope of robotics grow, they want to start a club of their own. We,
fortunately, were the one’s to help them take their first step in the
direction.

This workshop was taught by **Akshay Jain, Vidit Goel, Shubhika Garg,
Pranit Bauva and Rohan Sitanitya**.

The enthusiasm, or as we call it, the tempo of the students there is
definitely worth a mention. We successfully saw the determination and
interest of the students in the field and also to mentor such a great
lot was quite an experience.

Still a believer in Murphy’s law, I’d say we kicked it in the chin,
because no workshop could have gone this smooth.

We received an excellent welcome as soon as we reached Kolkata. We were
taken to their campus by a few undergraduate students of the university.
The next morning we got to the auditorium. The workshop started around
10:30, after a few word by a few people which multiplied together gets
pretty tiring pretty quick, but in this case, did not.

It was unusual to see so many dignitaries of the college, including the
dean, the Chancellor, the Vice Chancellor and few other office holders
have a common college as ours’. They were either the alumni or ex-profs
who retired a couple of years ago.

We finally began the day-1 of a 2 day workshop by teaching basic drive
mechanisms and other manual robotics stuff as lifting picking and placing
mechanisms. We then came to the next part of the workshop, which was
about basic electrical stuff that is most commonly used. Switches, relays
and control box were the menu. These were taught in detail till we were
sure everyone was along.

In the evening session, we demonstrated a bot that we specifically made
for the purpose. A stair climbing bot, using the skid steer drive and a
manual control box.

And finally before ending the day’s session, all the students were called
in groups to physically see what we learned all day. The bot was placed
open and students in a good number personally clarified all the doubts
and questions they had in mind. A little demonstration to soldering was
also in order at the same time.

Day-2 of the workshop was dedicated to autonomous robotics. This day saw
the better of students, as a greater number of students were actively
participating in the mentor-mentee conversation. They were now able to
see where all was going and seemed to enjoy when things started connecting.

We started with the basic flowchart of how an autonomous robot works,
the sensors, and the various suggested drives, the different types of
motors etc. The workshop carried on as we discussed microprocessors,
micro controllers and their basic parts. In the next session, we discussed
about the different sensors, how they are used, when they are used and
the tasks that can be done using those.

Motor drivers, different other voltage and current regulators and their
purpose, PWM etc were taught about. Later we gave the basic Arduino
coding tutorial, with a sample code that we used.
That was followed by the demonstration of another bot which was a
gesture-controlled bot. People really took a liking to it and looked
eager to make one. It was beautiful.

Towards the end of day-2 they were taught the basics of timers and
interrupts. And finally the implementation of robotics in various
research projects, here at IIT Kharagpur through Youtube videos gave
people something to look forward to.

The workshop ended with one and a half hour lecture on image processing.
What it is and where are its implications. Finally, it was followed by a
photo session to capture the beautiful memories that we made in just a
couple of days.

To sum up, the overall experience of the workshop was indescribable.
Bonding with  so many people over such a small span, teaching someone
what they really wanted to learn and dealing with a such an enthusiastic
lot who truly appreciate your input was beyond expressing. We wish them
luck for excelling in the field and feel deeply honored to be a part of
such a great initiative.

May the bots be with you!
