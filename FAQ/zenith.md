**Q: What is the restriction on motor specification?**

The motors for running the robot cannot exceed 200 RPM. High torque motors can be used and there is no lower limit on the RPM of the motors.


**Q: What are the dimensions of the obstacles?**

The dimensions of obstacles in different parts of the arena are different, their height ranges from 8 to 10 cms and their length depends on the arena. All the dimensions are specified in the images provided in the event document.


**Q: What is the maximum number of participants per team?**

There can be a maximum of four participants per team. However, there is no constraint of participants being from the same college or the same year of study etc.


**Q: Can one participant be in multiple teams?**

Yes, one participant can take part in multiple teams.


**Q: What will be the power supply?**

Team Robotix will provide a standard 220V, 50 Hz AC supply. The participants must bring their own adapters. If the participants wish to use high torque motors, they can. However, they have to ensure that no two points on the bot can have a potential difference of more than 24V.


**Q: Can the robot be wired?**

Yes, the robot can be wired or wireless. But the wires must be sufficiently long so that do not obstruct or disrupt the manoeuvring of the bot in any manner as this might lead to negative marks or even disqualification.


**Q: How to register?**

The registrations will begin soon.


**Q: What are the dimension constraints of the robot?**

The robot, in its most concise form, before the start of the run cannot exceed 30 cm * 30 cm * 30 cm. It can, however, enlarge itself during the run.

Arena related specifications
All the arena-related specifications and dimensions have been updated on the website. Find the link here: details of the event Zenith. For any further doubts contact us through our facebook page.


**Q: What are the dimensions of the gate?**

 The pole stands at a height of 30 cm, and the gate is 8 cm above the base, and in total its height is 18 cm. There will be a protusion with the help of which the bot will be able to lift the gate up at a height of 10 cm.


**Q: What does base score mean?**

It is the score that is awarded to each participant before the start of the run.


**Q: What is the time limit for each round?**

For the first round the time limit is 5 minutes, and for the second round is 7 minutes.


**Q: How many members per team can control the robot?**

Two members per team can control the robot simultaneously, who will remain the same throughout the run of the robot. That stands for both the rounds.


**Q: Can members swap during ongoing round itself?**

No, once a member(s) of the team takes control of the robot, the same members have to carry out the run till the end.


**Q: Can servo motors be used in the bot?**

Yes, they can be used. However, the participants must use IC555 to operate the servo motors and not the Arduino or any other microcontroller.


**Q: Can we make changes in the bot during the event?**

This is strictly prohibited and can lead to a disqualification that is completely under the discretion of Team Robotix.


**Q: Can we repair the bot if it gets damaged during the event?**

Yes, but no changes can be made to the bot during repairing and can lead to disqualification if any changes are discovered.


**Q: If two teams end on a tie what will happen?**

There will be a tiebreaker round in such a case. The final decision will, however, be taken by Team Robotix and will be final and binding.
