Being the first of its kind in Bangalore, this year an introductory workshop about the working of a Line Following robot was conducted at the M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology on the 8th of October. In addition the Robotix 2012 events were also publicized and the audience responded enthusiastically to this opportunity to display their Robotics skills.The workshop left the audience asking for more, with many in the audience remaining in touch with the Robotix team eager to learn further.
