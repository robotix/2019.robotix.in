The Kharagpur Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Group, conveniently called KRAIG, is the technical wing of Technology Robotix Society, and is a slightly larger group of students who learn robotics throughout the year and work on projects. Having cleared the test that is held soon after the start of the academic session and some introductory sessions, the members of KRAIG will be attending classes held on a weekly basis, conducted by those on campus experienced in the field.

The KRAIG classes will start from scratch, assuming very little prior knowledge, and will cover all the fundamental aspects of manual and autonomous robotics. The topics to be discussed will be announced and updated before each class. Moreover, for most of the theoretical classes, which will be held on Fridays or Saturdays, there will be an accompanying hands-on session so that members may get the practical exposure that will aid their learning. This general process will continue throughout the academic year.

In the winter, we will be hosting another of the memorable freshers' robotics events of the year; the annual Winter Workshop. Held in the winter vacations, in two phases to accommodate the astudents with EAA obligations, the Winter Workshop is where most of the first years make their first ever fully functioning autonomous or image processing robot from scratch, under the able guidance of their seniors. It is held for about a week, and is a period of intense learning and even more intense fun and enjoyment. A test will be conducted for participation in the Winter Workshop, towards the end of the semester.

Next year will see many of the KRAIG members participating with full gusto for the events of ROBOTIX 2013. It is our hope that the effort put into teaching them will pay off with dividend in January. Thereafter, we will be looking far and beyond to more advanced topics in autonomous robotics and image processing. All in all, it will be an extremely engaging and exciting year for all the people involved!
