Fugitives the autonomous event that looked simple but turned out to be the hardest nut to crack. Robotix 2011 saw some mind-boggling alorithms to corner the fixed fugitives which emitted infrared radiations. The problem statements were based on artificial intelligence used for guarding prisoners.

_**Trivia**: Fugitives was initially titled 'Chicken Run' as the idea was to have an event, analogous to catching chickens autonomously, meaning the fugitives were to be moving instead of static. But that would be taking the difficulty level overboard so the solution to the initial problem statement is being thought of as a project by our technical team._

Teams used different kinds of sensors and mechanisms to tackle this problem statement from Bluetooth to simply bump sensor circuitry. [![](http://robotix.in/rbtx11/my_site2/events_dock/images/fugitives.png)](http://robotix.in/rbtx11/my_site2/events_dock/images/fugitives.png)The event consisted of 3 rounds:

Round 1:   Corner 2 fugitives kept anywhere on a 10x10 grid Round 2 & 3:  Corner multiple fugitives which are kept randomly on the grid.
