Negotiators the online coding event of Robotix 2011 was an original design which went on to be largely successful. The participant's program was pitched against that of two others in order to negotiate a pattern on a grid with blocks.

_**Trivia:** Some participants submitted multiple entries hoping that their dummy entries would be pitted against their main ones. The attempt at hoodwinking was detected pretty early though and dummy entries ignored._

Maintaining a long standing record, students from IIT Kharagpur won all three prizes in this one.
