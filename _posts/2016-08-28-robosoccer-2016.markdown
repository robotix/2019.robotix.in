A robosoccer bot that participants made used differential drive mechanism to move around. The main aim of the robot was to play a game of soccer in one on one match against the other bot. Participants were supposed to make a suitable chassis design which can compete in the the match and also make the control box of the bot. Kraig classes 101 and 102 were conducted to teach the basic concepts of drive mechanism and circuitry used in control box.

The event was conducted on 28th august. A high turnout of participants was seen in the event. There were around 32 teams each consisting of 3 members. The event started in the morning around 10 and lasted till 9 in the evening.
