The latest version of HAL(Hybrid assistive Limb) is displayed at the Japan Robot Week exhibition in Tokyo. The body suit manufactured by Cyberdyne, which is the brainchild of Yoshiyuki Sankai, can be used by the workers at the Fukushima plant. The plant which witnessed one of the worst nuclear disasters, is being cleaned up by workers wearing of 60 Kg Tungsten vests . The usage of HAL helps in tackling the weight of the Tungsten vests, almost making it unnoticeable and also protects the workers from radiation. The fans provided inside the suit, helps in keeping the body temperature normal. The computers monitors the heart rate and breathing for signs of fatigue. The suit works by sensing the nerve signals from the brain to the muscles.
