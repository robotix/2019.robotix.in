As always during the autumn mid-semester break, Technology Robotix Society in collaboration with Kshitij, IIT Kharagpur organised  workshops all over the country. The workshops were conducted by members  of our society in 6 cities, and were attended by over 2000 students. These workshops are a manifestation of the efforts that we put in to spread the culture of robotics among students and to our elation these workshops received appreciation not only from the students but also from professors and robotics clubs present in these colleges.

The venues are shown here:

7/10/13 - Bhubaneswar - College of Engineering and Technology

9/10/13 - Chennai - SRM University

11/10/13 - Hyderabad - Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology

12/10/13 - Bangalore - University of Visvesvaraya - College of Engineering

15/10/13 - Jaipur - Apex Institute of Engineering and Technology

18/10/13 - Jalandhar - Lovely Professional University

Each workshop commenced with a brief introduction about our society, our fest ROBOTIX and the work we do. We then taught the students extensively about manual robotics, autonomous robotics and Image processing. We explained the necessary concepts, introduced them to the essential components and explained the procedure to make circuits for both manual and autonomous robotics. Basic fundamentals were presented in the field of image processing so that enthusiastic students could pursue it without much difficulty. The workshops also served as a platform for us to introduce and explain the events being conducted in our fest ROBOTIX 2014. We gave them a brief idea about the approach to the problem statements of the events and  explained the arenas and rules. The enthusiasm seen among the students for participating in the events, especially after learning the fundamentals, was very encouraging.

Even though in several colleges  students did not have a first hand experience in  making robots, their zeal and eagerness to learn served as a great motivation for us to teach. We look forward to these workshops every year so that a large number of students are benefited and one of our major goals is achieved - that of spreading the culture of robotics.

# It was a pleasure to be amongst all the workshop attendees this October. Hope to see you all in February during Robotix 2014. Happy bot-making!
