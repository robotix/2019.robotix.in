**Always on the forefront of robotics, Japanese brand Honda is launching a Roomba-like self-driving lawn mower dubbed Miimo, set to hit European markets in early 2013.**

Miimo comes in two models, the 300 and the 500 versions indicating the perimeter covered by the lawn mower, which stretches to 300m for one version and 500m for the other.

Honda says that once it's outside the device will mow the lawn several times a week following a random mowing pattern so as not to "ovestress" the lawn.

The grass will be cut at a length of 20 to 60 mm (0.79 to 2.36 inches) and, unlike the Roomba, there will be no bag to empty once the device has done its deed, because it just spreads the cut grass on the lawn to act as natural fertilizer.

The device is also able to keep its three blades clean on its own thanks to its ventilating system. The Miimo is powered by a lithium-ion battery, which can be recharged on its docking station.
