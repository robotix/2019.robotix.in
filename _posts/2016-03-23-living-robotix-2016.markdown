*21st January 2016­* - A Red Letter Day for all the technocrats eagerly waiting
for some dynamic events in the world of robotics.Precisely,it was the day
when curtains were raised for the annual Techno­management fest Kshitij
2016 and along with it was launched the 16th edition of the annual robotics
charade ,**ROBOTIX 2016!!**

Over the years, the popularity of the fest has increased by leaps and
bounds. It goes without saying that the standards have risen­ grown like
skyscrapers.The main target audience of the competitions was primarily the
undergraduate students of numerous technical institutions across India.The
events were ingeniously crafted for increasing the participation of students-
while maintaining the standards set by the previous iterations and overall
intricacy.

The events were categorized into Manual Robotics, Autonomous and Semi-
Autonomous Robotics and Computer Vision.

It was quite obvious that the *Manual* event **Summit** witnessed maximum
participation.Prima facie the problem statement included building a stair
climbing robot able to pick and store objects on its way. The event saw
some mind boggling designs and runs! The number of teams were close to
100.

The second manual event **Droid Blitz** was conducted in collaboration with
Kshitij. It required building an *Amphibious Robot*. This event also saw good
quality participation. It succeeded in pooling participation of 50 teams.

This year’s *Autonomous* Robotics events consisted of **Sherlock** and *Semi-
Autonomous* event **Warehouse** .With a combined participation of over 60
teams it proved that the events tested the mettle of participants.
IR reception and decoding along with path optimization and magnetic
heading following was the USP of sherlock, while Warehouse dealt with
gesture control robots capable of storing blocks based on their RFID tags.

**S.H.E.L.D.O.N**, the *Computer Vision* event required building of an
autonomous robot capable of detecting characters using concepts of Image
Processing and traversing them such that the expression satisfied a certain
condition.The challenge albeit difficult was tackled by some really nice
codes and algorithms and witnessed participation of 20 teams.

To wrap up the discussion we must admit that the annual robotics
extravaganza proved yet again to be a cherry on the cake for our techno-
management fest Kshitij.

KUDOS To the entire **Team Robotix** (*Technology Robotix Society*) for once
again proving their mettle and completing the fest with flying colours.
Living upto the phrase ‘Carpe Diem’,the participants, support team and
organising team succeeded in bringing out an awe­inspiring event which
was one of its kind.
So bidding Au revoir to Robotix 2016, we are indeed looking forward to
various meticulously planned events in near future.
Till then as we say, stay Geared Up!
