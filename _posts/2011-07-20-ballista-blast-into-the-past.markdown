**Ballista**, an autonomous events of Robotix 2011 was a night event with a rotating light source. This event enjoyed its status as belonging to the action-adventure genre in terms of robots.  The problem statement was derived from robot snipers on enemy territory . Robots were to detect walls and shoot at the light source from behind the walls. Lightly put, a James Bond interpretation of Wall-E.

_**Trivia**: Several rounds of prototyping were needed to develop the exact light source with a sliver of white light that would be intense enough for effective detection._

The winning team had a perfect run on the arena, thus proving that if you are like a determined Ballista you'll hit your targets spot on.

Detecting a light source, a wall and then caliberating the angle and force to shoot is not an easy task. But they did it! Robotix challenges you to the limit indeed.
