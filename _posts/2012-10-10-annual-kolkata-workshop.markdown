It's time once again for the awesome, fun-filled and now famous **Annual Kolkata Workshop** organised by Technology Robotix Society. Like every time, this year's workshop, is shaping up to be quite the show. Painstakingly made presentations are used to give the crowd a full introduction to the fundamentals of autonomous robotics and image processing. Participants can also look forward to live demonstrations of fascinating robots. The presentation will be followed by an introduction to events coming up in Robotix 2013.

![Autonomous Robot](http://www.bakatronics.com/images/FA1108.JPG) The Kolkata workshops routinely see a participation of close to a thousand people, with enthusiastic crowd members often having to be accommodated beyond the venue's capacity. This year promises to be no different and would leave you all amazed with the enigma of robotics. We hope to see all of you there!

**Date : 14th October,2012 (Sunday)**
