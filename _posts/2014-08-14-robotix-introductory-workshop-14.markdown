As it does every year, Technology Robotix Society organised a grand introductory workshop for the enthusiastic freshers of IIT Kharagpur who turned out in huge numbers, occupying every nook and cranny of Kalidas Auditorium to witness the magic of robotics. The workshop  began with a look into the work done by the society all through the years.They were informed about the workshops conducted by the society all across the country ,the in- house events , the projects that have been initiated and the technological extravaganza ROBOTIX which is held every year in January-February.Videos and photos of the previous edition of the fest fascinated the students and gave them a peek into the impact and outreach of Team Robotix.

There were demonstrations of some robots that left the audience awestruck. These demonstrations were just a trailer of the enthralling work done by the society all through the year. It started with an augmented reality game in which a volunteer from the audience played with the Kinect which can sense and map movements. This was followed by a demonstration of a light following robot . The robot could detect light and move towards it, turning it off as it touched the light. This demonstration left the audience bewildered. Also, the demonstration of a pipe- traversing robot made the audience cheer in unison.

After this they were given a brief introduction to the various events that will be held during ROBOTIX 2015. The students seemed very interested and enthusiastic, as if the events were to take place tomorrow! It truly was a fitting reward for the effort and hard work we had put in to make the show a grand success.
