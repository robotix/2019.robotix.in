**Robocop**, the Image Processing (IP) category event of Robotix 2011 was the first of its kind ever. The robots were required to be the judges of colour coded character, marked to be good (green)and bad (red). It required intricate programming and some teams even used stereovision camera feeds.

_**Trivia**: One of the participating 'robocops' was so accurate that it detected the red colour in the spectators' clothing and shot marbles at them. Digital cameras with red lights had to be removed from the arena because the robot also took shots __at them._

Mechanisms ranging from scissor extensions to air pressurised marble guns were used to topple the red cylinders (criminals).

**Rounds**: Traverse 4 rooms while toppling red cylinders in a time constraint.
